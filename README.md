Sunny Dayzz is an AI weather analyst.

This small application is written in Python.
I am using LangChain (Framework) to simplfy the coding and OpenAI API to execute the AI tasks.

The purpose of this application is to automate the task of searching online for predicted weather data and actual on-the-day weather data so we can track 
how accurate the predictions are and what discrepancies we might see.
Ideally, we also want to see how often it is sunny as opposed to cloudy.

I will be refining the search criteria (prompts) so that we can start getting a more concise output. But so far, not bad.
